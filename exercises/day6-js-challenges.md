## Warmup
Challenges 1 through 4 at [https://dwolverton.github.io/javascript-challenges](https://dwolverton.github.io/javascript-challenges/#!/c/basic/1).

Important tip on number 3. In order to return true, write this code verbatim: `return true;` and in or der to return false, write this code `return false;`. We will learn more about this later today.

## Challenge 1: Longer Name
* Start with two variables `name1` and `name2` which hold two names.
* The code should output the longer of the two names.

Example Output:
<pre>
Ada Lovelace has the longer name.
</pre>

## Challenge 2: Fizz Buzz
List integers 1-100. Numbers divisible by 3 should be replaced with the word "Fizz", those divisible by 5 replaced by the word "Buzz", and those divisible by both 3 and 5 replaced with the word "FizzBuzz".

Example:
<pre>
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
...
14
FizzBuzz
16
17
Fizz
...
98
Fizz
Buzz
</pre>

## Challenge 3: Sum
Find the sum of all the numbers in an array.

Example:

	var numbers = [ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ];
	// The answer should be 20.


## Challenge 4: Longest Name
Given an array of names, output the longest.

Example:

	var names = ["Rose", "Martha", "Donna",
	             "Amy", "Clara", "Bill"];
	// Should log "Martha" to the console.

## Challenge 5: Capitalize
Given a string, capitalize the first letter.

Example:

	var string = "what a fine day!";
	// Should log "What a fine day!".
	
	var string = "AMAZING";
	// Should log "AMAZING".

## Challenge 6: Square
*Wait until after the Functions lecture to do this.*

* Define a function `square` that returns the square of a number (the number times itself).
* Use the function to output 4 squared.
* Use the function to output 2 squared plus 3 squared.

Example Output:
<pre>
4 squared is 16.
2 squared plus 3 squared is 13.
</pre>
